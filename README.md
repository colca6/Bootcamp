# Bootcamp

This is UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp homework challenge Mod 1.  Excel. 

All formulas, tables and charts mine, except I "Asked the class" on the conditional formatting 3 color scale, and got some help from Pasindu Senaratne, a fellow student in class.

It uses a midpoint and end point, and we were supposed to use values of 100 and 200 for these, but this gave me errors. The solution was to use 1 and 2, respectively. I would still like an explanation on that.
